## ✨ Features

This calculator is packed with features to handle a wide range of tasks:

*   **Four Operating Modes:**
    *   **Basic:** For everyday arithmetic operations.
    *   **Scientific:** Includes trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, powers, factorials, and constants like π and e.
    *   **Unit Converter:** Convert between various units for Length, Mass, Temperature, Speed, Volume, and Digital Storage.
    *   **Graphing:** Plot multiple functions of `x` on an interactive canvas with zoom, pan, and trace controls.

*   **Themes & Personalization:**
    *   **Light & Dark Mode:** Seamlessly switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode.
    *   **Persistent Settings:** Your chosen theme, angle mode (DEG/RAD/GRAD), and calculation history are saved in your browser's local storage.

*   **User Experience:**
    *   **Calculation History:** A slide-out panel lists your previous calculations. Click any entry to reuse the result.
    *   **Responsive Design:** A fluid layout that adapts perfectly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    *   **Keyboard Support:** Use your physical keyboard for faster input of numbers and operations.
    *   **Memory Functions:** Standard `M+`, `M-`, `MR`, and `MC` memory operations.
    *   **Modern UI:** Neumorphic design, smooth transitions, and a satisfying ripple effect on button clicks.
